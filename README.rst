=======================================
Authentic 2 - Versatile Identity Server
=======================================

Authentic 2 is a versatile identity provider aiming to address a broad
range of needs, from simple to complex setups; it has support for many
protocols and can bridge between them.

Authentic 2 is under the GNU AGPL version 3 licence.

It has support for SAMLv2 thanks to Lasso, a free (GNU GPL)
implementation of the Liberty Alliance specifications.

Full documentation available on http://packages.python.org/authentic2.

Features
--------

Authentic can authenticate users against:
 - an LDAP directory,
 - a SAML 2.0 identity provider,
 - an OpenID identity provider,
 - with an X509 certificate.

Authentic can provide authentication to web applications using the following
protocols:
 - OpenID,
 - SAML 2.0,
 - CAS 1.0 & CAS 2.0.

Authentic can proxy authentication between any two different protocols it
support.

Installation
============

Authentic 2 installation script handles all the dependencies, except Lasso,
relying on the Setuptools and the pypi repository.

To run Authentic 2 you need to install Lasso >=2.3.6. You can obtain Lasso
from:

- From sources: http://lasso.entrouvert.org/download
- Debian based distribution: http://deb.entrouvert.org/

The other Authentic 2 dependencies are:

- django >= 1.3
- django-profiles >= 0.2
- south >= 0.7.3
- django-authopenid >= 0.9.6
- django-debug-toolbar >= 0.9.0

Install Authentic directly from pypi
------------------------------------

Using pip::

   pip install authentic2

or easy_install::

   easy_install authentic2

On first run you must create the database schema::

   authentic2-ctl syncdb --all
   authentic2-ctl migrate --fake

Then you can launch authentic::

   authentic2-ctl runserver

You should see the following output::

  Validating models...
  0 errors found

  Django version 1.4, using settings 'authentic.settings'
  Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

  You can access the running application on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Obtain the last package archive from pypi
-----------------------------------------

Download the archive on http://pypi.python.org/pypi/authentic2/.

Then, you can install it directly from the archive using pip::

   pip install authentic2-x.z.y.tar.gz

or easy_install::

   easy_install authentic2-x.z.y.tar.gz

On first run you must create the database schema::

   ./authentic2-ctl syncdb --all
   ./authentic2-ctl migrate --fake

You can now run Authentic from the installation directory, e.g.::

   authentic2-ctl runserver

You should see the following output::

  Validating models...
  0 errors found

  Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

  You can access the running application on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You may not want to install the authentic2 package or you may want to manage the dependencies
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Then, extract the archive::

   tar xzvf authentic2-x.z.y.tar.gz
   cd authentic2-x.z.y

You can now install the dependencies by hands or use pypi to install them as
follows, either::

   pip install django django-profiles south django-authopenid django-debug-toolbar

or using the dependencies version requirements::

   python setup.py egg_info
   pip install -r authentic2.egg-info/requires.txt

How to upgrade to a new version of authentic ?
==============================================

Authentic store all its data in a relational database as specified in its
settings.py or local_settings.py file. So in order to upgrade to a new version
of authentic you have to update your database schema using the
migration command â€” you will need to have installed the dependency django-south,
see the beginning of this README file.::

  authentic2-ctl syncdb --migrate

Specifying a different database
===============================

This is done by modifying the DATABASES dictionary in your local_settings.py file
(create it in Authentic project directory); for example to use PostgreSQL::

 DATABASES['default'] = {
   'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
   'NAME': 'authentic',
   'USER': 'admindb',
   'PASSWORD': 'foobar',
   'HOST': 'db.example.com',
   'PORT': '', # empty string means default value
 }

You should refer to the Django documentation on databases settings at
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#databases for all
the details.

Compiling translations
======================

Translations must compiled to be useful, to do that run the following command:

  ./setup.py compile_translations

Using Authentic with an LDAP directory
======================================

Authentic use the module django_auth_ldap to synchronize the Django user tables
with an LDAP. For complex use case, we will refer you to the django_auth_ldap
documentation, see http://packages.python.org/django-auth-ldap/.

How to authenticate users against an LDAP server with anonymous binding ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install the django_auth_ldap module for Django, for this you need
   python-ldap, python-ldap needs python developement headers to be installed
   but is usually packaged by most distributions::

 pip install django_auth_ldap


2. Configure your local_settings.py file for authenticating against LDAP.
   The next lines must be added::

 AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS += ( 'django_auth_ldap.backend.LDAPBackend', )

 import ldap
 from django_auth_ldap.config import LDAPSearch

 # Here put the LDAP URL of your server
 AUTH_LDAP_SERVER_URI = 'ldap://ldap.example.com'
 # Let the bind DN and bind password blank for anonymous binding
 AUTH_LDAP_BIND_DN = ""
 AUTH_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD = ""
 # Lookup user under the branch o=base and by mathcing their uid against the
 # received login name
 AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH = LDAPSearch("o=base",
     ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(uid=%(user)s)")

How to allow members of an LDAP group to manage Authentic ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. First you must know the objectClass of groups in your LDAP schema, this FAQ
   will show you the configuration for two usual classes: groupOfNames and
   groupOfUniqueNames.

2. Find the relevant groupname. We will say it is: cn=admin,o=mycompany

3. Add the following lines::

  from django_auth_ldap.config import GroupOfNamesType
  AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_TYPE = GroupOfNamesType()
  AUTH_LDAP_GROUP_SEARCH = LDAPSearch("o=mycompany",
            ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(objectClass=groupOfNames)")
  AUTH_LDAP_USER_FLAGS_BY_GROUP = {
    "is_staff": "cn=admin,o=mycompany"
  }

For an objectClass of groupOfUniqueNames you would change the string
GroupOfNamesType to GroupOfUniqueNamesType and grouOfNames to
groupOfUniqueNames. For more complex cases see the django_auth_ldap
documentation.

SAML 2.0
========

How to I authenticate against Authentic 2 with a SAMLv2 service provider ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 http[s]://your.domain.com/idp/saml2/metadata

And configure your service provider with it.

2. Go to the providers admin panel on::

 http[s]://admin/saml/libertyprovider/add/

There create a new provider using the service provider metadata and enable it
as a service provider, you can customize some behaviours like the preferred
assertion consumer or encryption for the NameID or the Assertion element.

CAS
===

How to use Authentic 2 as a CAS 1.0 or CAS 2.0 identity provider ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Activate CAS IdP support in your local_settings.py::

 IDP_CAS = True

2. Then create the database table to hold CAS service tickets::

 python authentic2-ctl syncdb --all
 python authentic2-ctl migrate --fake

2. Also configure authentic2 to authenticate against your LDAP directory (see
   above) if your want your user attributes to be accessible from your service,
   if it is not necessary you can use the normal relational database storage
   for you users.

3. Finally configure your service to point to the CAS endpoint at::

 http[s]://your.domain.com/idp/cas/

4. If needed configure your service to resolve authenticated user with your
   LDAP directory (if user attributes are needed for your service)


PAM authentication
==================

This module is copied from https://bitbucket.org/wnielson/django-pam/ by Weston
Nielson and the pam ctype module by Chris Atlee http://atlee.ca/software/pam/.

Add 'authentic2.vendor.dpam.backends.PAMBackend' to your
``settings.py``::

  AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
      ...
      'authentic2.vendor.dpam.backends.PAMBackend',
      ...
  )

Now you can login via the system-login credentials.  If the user is
successfully authenticated but has never logged-in before, a new ``User``
object is created.  By default this new ``User`` has both ``is_staff`` and
``is_superuser`` set to ``False``.  You can change this behavior by adding
``PAM_IS_STAFF=True`` and ``PAM_IS_SUPERUSER`` in your ``settings.py`` file.

The default PAM service used is ``login`` but you can change it by setting the
``PAM_SERVICE`` variable in your ``settings.py`` file.

Cronjobs
========

The following cronjob must be run to clean deleted accounts and temporary objects::

   5 0 * * * athentic2-ctl cleanup

It's made to run every day at 00:05.

Roadmap
=======

 - All (or nearly) settings will be configurable from the /admin panels
 - Login page will remember user choices for authentication and authenticate
   the user passively using hidden iframes
 - After a logout no passive login will be done
 - CAS IdP will allow to whitelist service URL and proxy granting ticket URLs,
   and to refuse request from unkown URLs. It will also allow to use patterns
   as URLs.
 - Extended CAS 2.0, with SAML attribute inside the CAS 2.0 validated ticket.
 - A virtual LDAP directory based on the OpenLDAP socket backend would remove
   the need for a real LDAP directory to pass user attributes to CAS relying
   parties.
 - WS-Trust token service endpoint
 - Email forwarder, so that relying parties never get the real user email.
 - Support slo in the CAS logout endpoint
