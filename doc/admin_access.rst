============================================
Access the grapical administration interface
============================================

The grapical administration interface is the 'Django admin' part of a Django
project. See for more information.

Just acces the admin url at http[s]://your.domain.com/admin.

At first you log with the superuser you created at the very first database
initialization.

Then you can configure other accesses to the admin checking the is_staff
option displayed on a user in the admin.
